# Homeworks (by Maria Zavadskaya)

This repository presents work on a practical task during the course **Algorithms and Big Data in Chemistry and Materials Science**.

* All $6$ homework assignments were completed

* All files located in this repository can also be found on the server: `10.135.34.169` at the following path `/Desktop/mzavadskaya`

### Homework $1$

My personal random state is $5$. Using it $20\ 000$ lines were selected from the general dataset `qm9.csv`.

Obtained dataset is presented in the file `data.csv`. 

Сode: [get_data.py](get_data.py)

### Homework $2$

Two libraries were chosen for unloading descriptors: `mordred` and `rdkit`.

The **result** of this hometask are files `data_with_descriptors.csv` and `data_clean.csv`.

Сode: [get_descriptors.ipynb](get_descriptors.ipynb)

Сode: [feature_selection.ipynb](feature_selection.ipynb)


### Homework $3$

Cleaning of dataset is presented in Jupyter notebook `data_curation.ipynb`. The **result** of this hometask are files `data_final.csv` and `data_normalized.csv` files.

Сode: [data_curation.ipynb](data_curation.ipynb)

### Homework $4$ and $5$

Dimension reduction was performed using:

- [ ] linear dimension reduction method: `PCA`
- [ ] non-linear dimension reduction method: `t-SNE` and `UMAP`

Clustering was performed using the `AgglomerativeClustering` and `DBSCAN`.
